# ASUTAAttendanceChecker
Short script to check which students attended the labs

# How to use
You will need two files: the google forms attendance sheet, and a sheet of the students you want to check. Both should be .xlsx files. The google form sheet should already be formatted correctly, but to be sure the email should be in the second column, and the name should be in the third. For the students you need to grade, copy from gradescope and paste into an excel sheet. Remove the extra columns so that the student name+email is in the first column. The cells should have the format `John Doe (example@email.com)`
